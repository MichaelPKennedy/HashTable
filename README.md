# HashTable
HashTable.java is a hash table programmed from scratch which includes both a typical hashing method as well as a folded square hashing method.
It also contains a put method which handles collisions using linear probing as well as a put method which handles collisions with chaining by turning the index of the 
array into a linked list. It also includes find methods as well as a contains method. HashTest.java creates a new hash table of 1000 nodes and inserts random values until 
.8 load factor is reached. The linear probing method is used for this demonstration. The number of collisions is printed as well as the number of nodes added.
